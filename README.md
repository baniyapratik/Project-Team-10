<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Our design is a Distributed Active Climate Control System for large data centers. The server racks are laid out in grids with cooling units and lighting units (for maintenance and operation). <br/>
<strong>Our system would utilize distributed low-cost IoT sensors to perform these tasks including: </strong> <br/>
    - Ambient Temperature Monitoring <br/>
    - HVAC Control (Small servo used to showcase fan operation) <br/>
    - Motion Sensing (If time permits) <br/>
    - Lighting Control (If time permits) <br/>
<strong>Features: </strong><br/>
    - Raspberry Pi Computing Module (Parent Node/Standalone) <br/>
    - WiFi MicroController (Optional for increased complexity) (Child Node/Stand alone IFFT Device) <br/>
    - Redundancy and node failover i.e. all nodes communicate at all times (If time permits) <br/>
    - Lab admins could monitor and analyze the energy consumption and efficiency of the lab via web  <br/>
<strong>Tech Stack: </strong><br/>
  - Hardware: Arduino and Raspberry Pi <br/>
  - Software: MERN stack, Kafka(*IFP), socket.io and Docker(*IFP) <br/>
